Bob, good job! You successfully beat the puzzle game!
Now if you want you can explore the world and play around, but if you prefer to leave you can too.
I hope you had fun completing these puzzles, I know I had fun helping you complete them.
It reminds me of our old adventures together...
...we really had fun when we were stealing the portal guns from those aliens, and their accents were so funny...
Sorry I was getting side-tracked.
I hope to see you again some day, good bye old friend!
