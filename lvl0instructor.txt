Well hello there, Bob. It appears we both somehow got stuck in this puzzle.
Do not worry, I have been here before, I know how we escape
Since last April when I fought those dinosaurs I have not been able to move my arms or legs so I will tell you what to do.
I forget how many levels there are, but once I am in them I will know how to solve it.
At the start of each level come to me and I will tell you what to do.

This puzzle world consists of a 3x3 grid of screens, which you can walk into.
You are currently in the middle screen, you should go walk around and explore the world.
To move from level to level, once you complete the mission you simply need to stand in the purple circle and press enter.
This is the introduction level, so there is no challenge. 
Once you have familiarized yourself with the map, feel free to move on to the first level. I will be waiting for you.
