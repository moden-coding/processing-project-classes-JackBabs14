Ah! Hello there.
This is the first level, this one is very simple.
There is a boy by the pond just south of here who lost his ball
All you have to do is return it to him.
Im sure you can find the ball on your own, just walk over it to pick it up and go talk to the boy.
Once you do that, you can move on to the next level.
