This is the final level, congrats! This one is complicated though.
The boy lost is ball but he thought that the worker took it so he hid the workers hammer in revenge.
First you have to return the ball to the boy and then he tell you where he hid the hammer.
The worker is by his car trying to leave but he needs his hammer first, hurry up.
